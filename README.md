[NanoBrowserQuest](https://nanobrowserquest.com) is a remake of the popular [BrowserQuest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrowserQuest) HTML5 mini-MMORPG that was originally created around 2012. The game supports 200 simultaneous player and is free to play. NanoBrowserQuest allows you to play with your friends, complete in-game achievements and get a small [Nano](https://www.nanolooker.com/what-is-nano) reward once the game is completed. The game is a proof of concept to highlight one of Nanoâ€™s greatest characteristics, in-game instant micro transactions. The idea behind this project is to inspires developers to integrate Nano into their games.
